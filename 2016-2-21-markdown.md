#Coding Blog

I have decided to start a coding blog to keep a record of my daily coding. 
I also wanted to get a good practice using markdown syntax. 

#Markdown Syntax
Markdown syntax styles documents in a more readable style on github, and I just realized that
I've been using this syntax without my knowing in Slack. 

We've started a new project to construct a website for a banking loan using Rails. 
The first sprint assigned was to create a table using a markdown syntax with the
software (database) requirements specification for registering a bank. 

An example: 

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```

would entail: 

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

which I used like this:

bank_name    | interest
------------ | -------------
string       | float

I've also learned that you need a new line before your markdown syntax or it will not convert properly.
